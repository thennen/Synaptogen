# Synaptogen.py

This is a quick translation of Synaptogen into Python.

The code is not highly optimized and is considerably slower than the Julia version.

## Installation

```
pip install synaptogen
```

## Examples

This basic example does the following:
- Initialize a million memory cells (in their high resistance states)
- Apply -2 V to each cell, putting them into their low resistance states
- Apply a random voltage to each cell
- Make a current readout of all the cells individually (at a default of 0.2 V)
- Perform a "Vector Matrix Multiplication" by 1024Ã—1024 crossbar readout


```python
from synaptogen import *
import numpy as np
M = 1024 * 1024
cells = CellArrayCPU(M)

applyVoltage(cells, -2)

voltages = np.random.randn(M)
applyVoltage(cells, voltages)

I = Iread(cells)

col_voltages = np.random.randn(2**5) * .2
row_currents = cells @ col_voltages
```
