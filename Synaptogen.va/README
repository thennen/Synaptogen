Version 1.0 of Synaptogen Verilog-A for use in Circuit Simulators (Cadence Virtuoso et al.). 
Before use, 
1)	generate a new Cell View and copy the .va script into the corresponding folder. 
2)	If used in circuit schematic, draw an additional symbol with two InOut terminals labelled “In” and “Out”.

Pre-Defined parameters muDtD, LDtD, GammaCoeff, VAR_L, VAR_An, HHRS, LLRS, wk, eta, Umax, p and U0 must not be changed!

In order to incorporate Device-to-Device variability, every device needs an unique random number as seed (parameter Initialseed) which has to be assigned in the schematic or during device definition in netlist.

Model carries an intrinsic step size control dependent on parameter tcycle (check lines 282 – 305) which adapts the number of simulated data point in the vicinity of SET and RESET transitions.
